calculon
========

A bpython-based programmer's calculator
---------------------------------------

I haven't found many decent programmer's calculators for Mac and I spend a fair bit of time copying and pasting between Calculator.app and a python REPL, so I figured I'd have a go at writing a quick terminal-based calculator using curses.

Calculon is basically a curses window tacked onto `bpython`. Type python code into the `bpython` prompt, and any sane numeric values that come out will be displayed.

Dependencies
------------

Requires `bpython`.

Installation
------------

A standard `setuptools` script is included.

    # python setup.py install


Configuration
-------------

An example config (`example.cfg`) is included with the source. Copy it to `~/.calculon/config` and edit it if you like, otherwise the defaults in the `defaults.cfg` will be used.

Usage
-----

	$ calculon

Totally doesn't support any command line args yet.

The REPL prompt is basically just `bpython`, so any python code will work. Calculon adds some top level functions for watching variables. calling the `watch()` function with a variable name (and optional output format) will add the named variable to the variable display below the binary display.

	>>> watch("somevar")
	>>> watch("anothervar", "d")

Now when these variables are updated:

	>>> somevar = 1234
	>>> anothervar = 1234

Their values will be tracked. Variables can be removed from this display with the `unwatch()` function:

	>>> unwatch("somevar")

Calculon now has support to connect to [voltron](https://github.com/snarez/voltron) and inspect register state. If you have the most recent version of calculon and voltron, and voltron is running, calculon will connect to it at startup. Calculon can manually connect and disconnect from voltron as follows:

	>>> V.connect()
	Connected to voltron
	>>> V.disconnect()
	Disconnected from voltron

When connected to voltron, calculon can inspect registers:

	>>> V.rip
	4294971201

Or look at memory:

    >>> V[V.rbp]
    'x'

Or a region in memory:

    >>> V[V.rbp:V.rbp + 32]
    'x\xee\xbf_\xff\x7f\x00\x00\xfd\xf5\xad\x85\xff\x7f\x00\x00'
